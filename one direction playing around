<p>If this room was <em style= "color: orange;">burning</em></p>

<strong>I wouldn't even notice</strong>
<p>'Cause you've been taking up my mind <font size="+4"> <meta charset="UTF-8"> ðŸ§  </font></p>
<p>With your <font size="+3">little white lies, <em style="color:gold;"> white lies!</em></font></p>

<p>You say it's getting late</p>

<p>It's getting late</p>
<p>And you don't know if you can stay</p>

<p>If you can stay</p>

<p>But you, you don't tell the truth</p>
<p>No you, you like <font size="+2"> <strong> playing games <meta charset="UTF-8">ðŸŽ² </strong></font></p>

<p>Your hands touching me, they're touching me</p>
<p><font size="+5"> and your <em style="color:blue;">eyes <img src="https://guycounseling.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/ian-sod.gif" alt="eyes"></em> keep saying things</font></p> 

<p>They say what we do</p>
<p>When it's only me and you</p>
<p><strong>I can't concentrate</strong></p>

<p>That's all I'm thinking about</p>
<p>All I keep thinking about</p>
<p>Everything else just fades away</p>

<p>If this room was burning</p>
<p>I wouldn't even notice</p>
<p>'Cause you've been taking up my mind</p>
<p>With your little white lies, little white lies</p>

<p>You say you're a good girl
But I know you would girl
'Cause you've been telling me all night
With your little white lies, little white lies
With your little white lies, little white lies</p>

Back seat of the cab,
We're in the cab
My lips getting so attached,
They're so attached

Now you wanna make some rules
Now cool then we'll watch them break tonight

I know what you want
And I've been waiting so long

If this room was burning
I wouldn't even notice
'Cause you've been taking up my mind
With your little white lies, little white lies

You say you're a good girl
But I know you would girl
'Cause you've been telling me all night.
With your little white lies, little white lies
With your little white lies, little white lies

I know you want it
I know you feel it too
Let's stop pretending
That you don't know what I don't know
Just what we came to do

If this room was burning
I wouldn't even notice
'Cause you've been taking up my mind
With your little white lies, little white lies

You say you're a good girl
But I know you would girl
'Cause you've been telling me all night
With your little white lies, little white lies
With your little white lies, little white lies
